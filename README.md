# UnityMobilePlugin

Example project for creating iOS and Android plugin for Unity.
In detail, there are already working library for each mobile platform. We include it in Unity project working with our wrapper class.
This mean with this approach, we can create a working Unity plugin package (.unitypackage) later.

The example uses Playbasis mobile SDK.

It uses Unity 5.3.2f1.
